# odin-landing-page

The content of this page is not serious, it is a bunch of nonsense. It's supposed to show my knowledge of CSS and HTML as of this moment, it's the culmination of the stuff I learned from The Odin Project so far. It was mostly following the already existing design that was supposed to be recreated by just looking at the image of it. I've added some personal elements to it. It was originally supposed to be about Bloodborne, but fearing copyright issues, I've decided to show the cars I used to drive, only to realize there isn't much to show. It is a bit of a joke, this whole page.
